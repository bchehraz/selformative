Learning something new is as easy as pie... or is it?

When learning something new, there exists a certain level of attention that must be provided to the topic in order for our brains to create new connections and to strengthen existing ones. One reason why homework is given after class is to help engrain information in your brain by practicing new concepts in different ways. And that's the reason why a learning guitarist may spend hours a day practicing various chords and riffs. An expert in a topic knows the subject so well that any question you send their way, they can give a definitive answer to.

<h3>So, How Do We Learn a New Skill?</h3>

<h4>1. Pick a Skill</h4>

The first thing you want to do is pick a skill that you would like to learn. Here are some examples to get you going.

<ul>
  <li>Communicating (in front of a group, talking to people, making friends, teaching, etc)</li>
  <li>Programming/Coding/Developer</li>
  <li>Cooking</li>
  <li>Diet and/or Exercise</li>
  <li>Cooking</li>
  <li>English Reading, Writing, Grammar, Punctuation</li>
  <li>Musical Instrument</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>

Even anger management could be a skill you acquire over time!
